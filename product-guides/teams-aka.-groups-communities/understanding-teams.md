## How Teams work

Teams are a huge feature within Catalyst, but it can be difficult to fully grasp the power they bring.

They are similar to Groups in Facebook, but they provide a lot more customization and power.

* an example of this is we allow custom Roles and Permissions so you can build a team behind your community to help you manage it. If the Team is for an organization, you can use this to add volunteers, staff, etc.&#x20;

They are similar to Servers in Discord, but they aren't as siloed.

* an example of this is we allow Teams to interact with each other and show their posts in the Home feed of the platform if they want, similar to how Facebook Groups do. We also have Forms

Teams allow you to have sub-communities within a platform where the Owner of the team can:

* Grow a following/community for a specific cause, project, organization, etc.
* Share news with their audience
* Offer monthly Subscriptions to their followers for enhanced features like exclusive access & perks
* Customize Roles and Permissions within the Team (Learn More **here**)
* Create custom Forms for their members to fill out (ie. surveys, requests, etc.) and manage the Submissions
* More to come!
